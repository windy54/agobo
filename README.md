# agobo
line following programs for agobo 4tronix robot

The Scratch file myLineFollower seems to handle all turns apart from 90 deg turns. It is based on
simon walters youtube video. Occassionally it locks up and scratch has to be close down and reopened.
When this happens the robot does stop.

The python file uses the same logic as the Scratch program and does not appear to lock up.

I have included the agobo file that comes with the robot because I changed the logic for the ir
routines. They were inverted for the logic I was trying to implement.
